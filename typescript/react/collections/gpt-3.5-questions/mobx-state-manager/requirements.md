# MobX State Management

Imagine you are building a simple task management application using React and MobX. Your application has tasks, and you need to implement MobX stores to manage the state of these tasks.


Requirements:


1. Create a MobX store for managing tasks. The store should have the following features:

An observable array to store the tasks.
Actions to add tasks, remove tasks, and update task properties.
Computed properties to get the total number of tasks and to filter tasks based on their status (e.g., completed, pending).

2. Create a React component that uses the MobX store to display the list of tasks. The component should:

Display the task list.
Allow users to add new tasks.
Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
Allow users to remove tasks.
Display the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

3. Create a separate React component for rendering individual tasks.

4. Demonstrate the integration of MobX with React components to ensure that changes in the store automatically update the UI.


Please provide the code for your MobX store and React components, and demonstrate how they work together to manage and display tasks. If you encounter any challenges or have questions during the implementation, feel free to ask for guidance or clarification. Happy coding!
